# {{PROBLEM}} Multi-Class Planned Design Recipe

## 1. Describe the Problem

As a customer
So that I can check if I want to order something
I would like to see a list of dishes with prices.

As a customer
So that I can order the meal I want
I would like to be able to select some number of several available dishes.

As a customer
So that I can verify that my order is correct
I would like to see an itemised receipt with a grand total.

>Use the twilio-python package to implement this next one. You will need to use mocks too:

As a customer
So that I am reassured that my order will be delivered on time
I would like to receive a text such as "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52" after I have ordered.

## 2. Design the Class System

_Consider diagramming out the classes and their relationships. Take care to
focus on the details you see as important, not everything. The diagram below
uses asciiflow.com but you could also use excalidraw.com, draw.io, or miro.com_

* Nouns:
menu
order
list of dishes
prices
text confirmation


* Verbs:
add dishes
select number of dishes
verify correct order: see receipt with grand total
text confirmation

```

```

_Also design the interface of each class in more detail._

```python
class Menu:
    # User-facing properties:
    #   dishes: list of instances of Dishes

    def __init__(self):
        # side effect: initialises an empty list
        # returns: nothing
        # self.dishes = []
        pass 

    def add(self, dish):
        # Parameters:
        #   dish: an instance of Dishes
        # Side-effects:
        #   Adds the dish to the dishes property of the self object
        # Returns nothing
        pass 

    def all_list_of_dishes(self):
        # Returns:
        #   A list of the Dishes instances
        pass 


class Dishes():
    # User-facin (Public) properties:
    #   name: string representing a name of a dish
    #   price: a float representing the price of a dish

    def __init__(self, name, price):
        # Parameters:
        #   name: string
        #   price: float
        # Side-effects:
        #   Sets the above (name and price) properties
        pass 

class Order():
    def __init__(self, menu):
        # side effect: initialises an empty list
        # returns: nothing
        # 
        # selected_dishes = []

    def add(self, dish_name, quantity):
        # dish_name: string, an instance of Dishes, 
        #    representing a dish selected by the user
        # quantity: int representing a number of dishes selected

    def generate_receipt(self):
        # returns:
        # a list of selected dish_names with selected quantity and price (quantity * price)
        # a grand total:
        # Total = a float, representing a sum of all dishes prices 
        # a string:
        #'Order Total': nÂ£



```

## 3. Create Examples as Integration Tests

_Create examples of the classes being used together in different situations and
combinations that reflect the ways in which the system will be used._

```python
# EXAMPLE

"""
Given a library
When we add two tracks
We see those tracks reflected in the tracks list
"""
library = MusicLibrary()
track_1 = Track("Carte Blanche", "Veracocha")
track_2 = Track("Synaesthesia", "The Thrillseekers")
library.add(track_1)
library.add(track_2)
library.tracks # => [track_1, track_2]
```

## 4. Create Examples as Unit Tests

_Create examples, where appropriate, of the behaviour of each relevant class at
a more granular level of detail._

```python
# EXAMPLE

"""
Given a track with a title and an artist
We see the title reflected in the title property
"""
track = Track("Carte Blanche", "Veracocha")
track.title # => "Carte Blanche"
```

_Encode each example as a test. You can add to the above list as you go._

## 5. Implement the Behaviour

_After each test you write, follow the test-driving process of red, green,
refactor to implement the behaviour._
